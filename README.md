# BugCore-BSPWM

My previous personal dotfiles for BSPWM, PolyBar, Rofi, Neofetch, and more!

The wallpaper is from the Linux Mint 22 artwork.

## Installation (Manual)

You will need the following packages: `bspwm, rofi, polybar, sxhkd, dunst, cronie, lf, nemo, qutebrowser, mpd, ncmpcpp`  
These can easily be installed with `apt` or other distro's package managers.

Copy everything in the `config` folder to `~/.config` and copy the files in `bin` to `~/.local/bin`  
Add the `~/.local/bin` folder to your PATH in your `.bashrc` file.

## Installation (Automated, package install only on Debian/downstream)

**BACK UP YOUR DOTFILES!!** Any data loss is *not my problem*  
Run the `install.sh` file and then add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH.
Logout and choose the `bspwm` session.

Have Fun!
